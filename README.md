# sysnotifsnooze
This is a fork of the awesome Android app by @iboalali. All credit goes to him and although I've removed the donations from in-app I suggest if you find this useful you toss him a couple dollars for his work.

If you have no reason to build this from source and/or have access to the Google Play Store, you can download this directly from the original author here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iboalali.sysnotifsnooze


The reasons for the fork are twofold:

1. I found the permissions this app requires to remove 1 annoying notification warranted taking a look at the actual source to determine if I actually wanted to install it.
2. It's a bit of extra work for the original author to upload to Fdroid so I thought I'd save him the time
